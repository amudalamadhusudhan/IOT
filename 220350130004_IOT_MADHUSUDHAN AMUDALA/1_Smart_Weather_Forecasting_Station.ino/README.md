## Design a Smart Weather Forecasting Station

    • Measures Atmospheric pressure, temperature,humidity, light intensity, wind direction & speed.
    • Get all data to online portal for analysis
    • Live data monitoring
    • Intimating the local departments.

### Selection of Processor/SoC
    -I am using ESP32 because i want to work with GPIOs and wifi and this board is cheap and best for this task.

### Sensors Used-
    - Atmospheric pressure - MPL3115A1 
    - Temperature and humidity- DHT11
    - Light intensity- LDR 
    - Wind direction- Anemometer
    - Wind speed- Rotating cup anemometer

### Cloud
    - ThingSpeak

### Software Development 
    - Arduino IDE
